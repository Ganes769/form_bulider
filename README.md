# Drag-and-Drop Form Builder

A simple drag-and-drop form builder built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to drag form elements such as `input`, `textarea`, `radio`, and `select` onto a canvas and customize the form.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop functionality for form components.
- Real-time form field rendering (input fields, radio buttons, textareas, select dropdowns).
- Form submission with validation (using `react-hook-form` and `zod`).
- Integration of drag-and-drop with `react-dnd` library.
- Tailwind CSS styling for a responsive and modern UI.
